                <p>
                    I was chilling in Udaipur then one day Dhyaan called me and he asked me sup man what are you doing??,
                    I replied fam i am chilling in udaipur with my family then he told me diya was asking about me like how am i what i am doing etcc.
                    Then dhyaan told me do you know that diya is using a dating app?? I said, Howw she's not even 18 how the heck she's using then he toldme it's a app for teens
                    like you can dfind new friends and talk to them and even you can date them and the name of the app was "Wink" I also installed it created a profile I've received a lot of requests from many girls,
                    and also talked to them but the vibe was not matching at that time i was suffering from hear-break, trauma, depression, anxiety attacks and many more..
                    Then somehow I got to know that my ex is gonna text me i waited for her text but it was useless anyways then i returned to home. This was just a intro about our story. Now I'll tell you how i met you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day I was chilling at home scrolling Instagram i don't know wheter it was noon or evening but whaterver it is, I've received a notification from Wink that I've received a friend request from chhavi agrawal then I accepted that request it was the best decison I've ever made.
                    Then I texted her "hi" then we started talikng on wink then I ask her to talk on instagram I asked her social handle she gave me themn I've sent her the request on instagram then we started yalking on instagram.
                    It was 20 June 2023 the first day when we started talking and after sometimes she asked me to be her best-friend I said her, But she didn't knew from the moment i've seen her I started falling for her.
                    I asked her snap Id she gave me theen we started talikng there too she started sending me snaps i've sent too at that time I learned Perfect by ed sheeran on piano i sent her the video she said it's fab then we talked more more and more.
                    On 22 June 2023 (11:26 pm) I finally proposed to her but i was scared what if it'll ruined my friendship wit her. We were strangers at first now she's became my fav person the person who's very close to my heart.
                    I thought It was only one sided but I was totally wrong It was from both the sides. She's in grade 10 and current in hostel in Chattisgarh but every sunday she gets her phone so we talk on call for like 10 min but sometimes i miss her calss then i regret why did i missed her calls????
                    One day she called me and said I am comung to ahmedabad for a school trip from that day I'm very exicted to meet her. She's coming on 27 October
                </p>

                    I love you a lott sunshineeee...... I promise you one day I am gonna marry you no matter wwho's against me I made up my mindd that I only want you then that's it and I ain't gonna cheat on you
                    You're my sunshine, soulmate, home, peace, world, universe everything. The first think and the last thing  that comes to my mind is you at the start and end of the day when i wake up and when i sleep.
