            <p>So, From where should I start, It's a kind of cute and unexpected relationship with her.
                She is the one who made me feel like home, she is my best friend, my everything
                I met her through a kind of online dating app for teens the name of the app was "Wink". 
                I got to know about wink through one of my friend he called me one day and he said dude did you check out this app know as wink?
                I said to him le me check out so I downloaded the app I made a profile in it and I got request from many girls I talked to them but nobody made me felt like her.
                One day I was at my home just scrolling instagram I've received a Notification from Wink and that notification changed my whole life.
                And the notification was "You've received a friend request form Chhavi Agrawal so I accepted it and then we both shared our socials like instagram and I texted her "HI"
                We started talking about our lives, discussed about our Career and many other things too. I was getting attached to her we both sent some reels to each other.
                And finally on 22 June I proposed to her first then I thought what if she didn't liked me I was scared but it was from both sides I am lucky to have you babe.. 
                She has to go to hostl for her studies and she's in grade 10 but she'll be in grade 11 next year. We both talk only on sunday for around 10-15 min when she gets her phone on sunday evening so she calls me sometimes I misses her calls that shit hurted me that I shoudn't have missed her calls.
                We both got into a relationship on 22 June 2023 (11:26 pm) It was the best decision I've ever made. The only thing that scares me what is she leaves me??? but I know she won't do this cuz we both can't live without each other.
                On 22 October 2023 it's going to be the 4 month of our relationship and soon we'll get married in our upcoming future we'll both fight from the challenges.
                She knows that I love her but she has no idea how much I love her when someone asks about her I can't stop talking about her cuz I really lover her.
                She's the first girl who made me fell like Yeah I can be loved she cared for me I know she's a lil, clumpsy kid but for me she's all that i've ever wanted in a girl.
                Our Journey will continue for a long time. My goal is to make her my wife that's it and I am gonna make her my wifeyy.
                This was just a short introduction about us.
                Love you a lot bachaaa.....

            <h3>Her Irresistible Charms</h3>
            <p>While coding this part I cried cuz it's the connection the emotional connection with you babe &#129402;. 
               It all started with your smile the moment when you sent me the first snap of yours when you did your haircut at that time I started feeling for you.
               I didn't knew but it just happened unexpected now it's the best thing that happened to me.
               Her face, fraamed by those expressive eyes and you know what's my fav sound??? It's your voice my girl.
               But it wasn't just her physical beauty that draw me in; it was her behaviour and her charmingly childish side;
               Her eyes are like the nature once you saw it you got lost in it and if you're once lost in it you can't come back.
               Her voice &#128563;. Once you hear it you're like damn.
               Everytime when she says I love you mera bachha the way she says it gaves ne butterflies every single time.
               If she had done anything wrong and If I am mad at her the way she says sorry na bachaaa melts my heart and I forgive her every time.
               She don't know but my biggest fear is to loose her and my weakness is her itself. When I'm with her I feel vulnerable.

                The moment she came in my life my life has been evolved so much. I was suffering from depression, heart-break and many more issues when she came in my life,
                She healed all of them and made me shine again this time I knew it she's the one for me.
