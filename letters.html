                <p>Dear, Mansi</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I wanted to take a moment to pour my feelings onto this page because words alone can't express the depth of my love for you. 
                   From the very first day we met, my life took on new meaning, and every moment with you has been a treasure.</p>
                <p>Your smile is like the sunrise, casting warmth and light on the darkest of days. Your presence is a soothing balm to my heart, bringing me comfort and joy. Each day, 
                    I find my love for you growing stronger, deeper, and more profound. You are the love of my life, the one I've been waiting for, 
                    and I can't imagine a life without you.</p>
                <p>You are my confidant, my soulmate, my rock, and my inspiration. With you, I've discovered a love so pure and true that it's beyond words.
                    I hope it captures even a fraction of what I feel for you
                </p>
                <p>No matter where life takes us, always remember that my love for you is unwavering and eternal. You mean the world to me, and I'm grateful for every moment we share together.</p>
                <p>Love youu bachaaaaaaaa.&#128151;</p>
